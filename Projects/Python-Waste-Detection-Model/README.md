# Python Waste Detection Model

## Overview

This project implements a waste detection model using machine learning techniques to classify different types of waste. The model aims to support environmental efforts by identifying recyclable and non-recyclable materials.

## Features

- Image classification for various types of waste (e.g., plastic, metal, paper).
- Trained on labeled datasets to optimize accuracy.
- Efficient and scalable model architecture.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** For building and training the machine learning model.
- **OpenCV:** For image processing.
- **NumPy & Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** Visualization of model performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amy-caruana/ac-portfolio.git
   cd ac-portfolio/Projects/Python-Waste-Detection-Model
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset by placing images in the `data/` folder.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the model or use it for predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image_path path_to_image.jpg
   ```

## Project Structure

```

## Results

- Achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset (replace with actual results).
- Visualizations of training performance available in the `results/` directory.
