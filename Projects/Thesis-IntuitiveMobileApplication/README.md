# Intuitive Mobile Application for Greenhouse Temperature Prediction

Welcome to my **Intuitive Mobile Application** that I created for my thesis! This mobile application was developed to help farmers regulate temperatures in greenhouses for optimal crop yield. The application uses **Machine Learning** models (LSTM and GRU) and integrates with a **Weather API** to predict future temperatures based on real-time weather data.

## üöÄ Installation

To run the application locally or on your Android device, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amy-caruana/ac-portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Open the project in Android Studio**:
   - Launch Android Studio and open the `Thesis-IntuitiveMobileApplication` project.

3. **Install dependencies**:
   - Make sure all necessary dependencies are installed in Android Studio.
   - The machine learning models are pre-trained, but you can modify or retrain them if needed.

4. **Run the application**:
   - You can either run the app on an emulator or connect an Android device and deploy it directly.
   - The application will fetch live weather data and provide temperature predictions for greenhouses.
